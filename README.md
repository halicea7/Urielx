### *"Initium sapientiae timor Domini, et scientia sanctorum prudentia."*  
**_"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding."_**  
‚Äî üìú *Proverbia 9:10*


# Introduction

Welcome to **Uriel**, the research assistant that doesn‚Äôt just *whisper* knowledge‚Äîit *wields* it like a flaming sword. Named after the archangel of wisdom and enlightenment, this project aims to bring divine-level intelligence to your research workflows (minus the apocalyptic visions... probably).  

##  What is Uriel?  
Uriel is a **multipurpose research tool** that harnesses the power of **local LLMs** (because cloud dependencies are just overpriced rent). It uses **Ollama** for running models efficiently on your own hardware and employs **CrewAI** to orchestrate agents with distinct roles, working together to crush complex research tasks.  

##  Why Should You Care?  
- **No Divine Intervention Needed**: Everything runs locally, so no need to pray for API credits or cloud uptime.  
- **Agentic Intelligence**: CrewAI allows multiple specialized agents to collaborate, making Uriel more than just another chatbot‚Äîit‚Äôs a tactical knowledge strike team.  
- **Flexible & Extensible**: Whether you're doing literature reviews, data analysis, or scraping arcane PDFs for forbidden knowledge, Uriel adapts.  

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works  
1. **Fire Up Ollama**: Load up your preferred LLMs‚Äîno need for OpenAI‚Äôs blessings.  
2. **Summon Your Agents**: CrewAI constructs specialized entities to research, summarize, and analyze data.  
3. **Receive Divine Insights**: Ask Uriel a question, and it will deliver knowledge like a seraphim delivering bad news.  

## Requirements
```bash
python 3.10
crewai==0.28.8
crewai_tools==0.1.6
langchain_community==0.0.29
langchain_openai==0.2.1
python-dotenv==1.0.1
openai==1.3.0
duckduckgo-search==3.0.0
```
## ‚ö° Installation & Setup  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/halicea7/Uriel.git
cd Uriel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(You might also need to make a blood sacrifice to your GPU, but that‚Äôs standard.)  

## üèõÔ∏è Future Plans  
- **Multi-agent collaboration enhancements** (because even angels need better teamwork).  
- **Improved document ingestion** (so Uriel can parse everything from PDFs to ancient scrolls).  
- **Fine-tuned local models** for even sharper analysis.
